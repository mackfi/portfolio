											<a href="https://github.com/mackfi/ytmusic-clone" class="image"><img src="images/musicApp.png" alt="A screenshot displaying the music application." /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Music Web Application</h3>
											<p>Full-stack music app created with Next.js, React, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS, deployed at <a href="https://musaic.online">musaic.online</a>. This project required many different technologies that I am not very familiar with, pushing me far outside my comfort zone. I was having problems with processing payments and certain changes not being reflected in the database, but I was happy to have resolved these issues and to move forward with officially deploying to the web for the first time. Though I would like to expand on this project in the future to differentiate it from other music apps, I am content with the features I was able to provide.</p>

											<a href="https://github.com/mackfi/Wordle.App" class="image"><img src="images/wordleApp.png" alt="A screenshot displaying the wordle application." /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Wordle Application</h3>
											<p>A recreation of the infamous word game "Wordle" built in .NET MAUI with C#. I encountered a data set with thousands of five-letter words, which inspired me to recreate this game from the ground up without outside help. Though there were some challenges working with the data set, I enjoyed thinking through some of the logic behind validating a player's guess and displaying the appropriate information.</p>

											<a href="https://github.com/mackfi/SwiftApp" class="image"><img src="images/swiftIcon.webp" alt="The Swift programming language icon." /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Multipurpose Calculator Application</h3>
											<p>Native iOS application built with Swift. This was part of an Apple workshop series with the university, in which each individual learns the fundamentals of SwiftUI and creates their own application. Connecting multiple functional views together proved to be a challenging task, especially with the layout of a mobile device and the unique native components of an iOS app.</p>

											<h3 class="major">2D Unity Platformer</h3>
											<p>Simple yet satisfying 2D game built with C# using the Unity engine. Entire project created in 48 hours for the Neumont College of Computer Science Summer Game Jam. This was also my first time developing in a game engine, which presented its own set of challenges. Given the short time-frame and my inexperience, I was pleasantly surprised with my final product.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Relevant Course Projects</h2>
									<p>These are some projects I have created in my academic coursework:</p>
									<p>For the sake of academic integrity, my academic projects are not public. I would still like to discuss the skills exercised in each project along with my thought processes and overall experiences.</p>

										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/spreadsheetDark.png" alt="A screenshot displaying the spreadsheet application." /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Spreadsheet</h3>
											<p>A fully functional spreadsheet capable of evaluating formulas, restoring files, and more. This was my first true test of implementing good software practices, as the duration of this project would span several months. Ensuring good naming conventions, documentation, and using scalable code were all critical throughout the development process.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Learning Management System (LMS)</h3>
											<p>This project is actively being worked on in one of my courses. So far, we have dived into the importance of proper HTML/CSS to create semantically meaningful and well-designed web pages. We have also utilized Django to create dynamic web pages that query information from a database and display that information in template pages. In the future, we will implement authentication and deploy the website with AWS.</p>
